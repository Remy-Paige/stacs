Algerrithm Chapter 3

Dijkstra started at point A, so he got piece of paper A out of his bag and threw it away
so he knew not to approach the destination again.
From there, he could go to points B or C.
He tries both, and finds out how long it takes to go to each.
*Click on the paths to see how long each takes*
Because of the time talking to babbling sponsors, the other path is obviously quicker
than the other.
He writes down how long it took on his map, and goes back to point A to see the progress
of his team's actual hack.
