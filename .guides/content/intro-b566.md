It was a good day at the Stacs Hackathon. Programmers typing, Hackers coding. Left and 
right, forward and back.
Everywhere, as far as the eye can see (indoors of course).
Just like every other Hackathon in the world, everyone attending has only 24 hours to
create and present their 'hack', a program made from scratch within that time.
However, some of the attendants are so determined that they are willing to put ALL 24
hours to the fullest. And just like every other human being, the inevitable will occur:
HUNGER.
If not resolved, they become HUNGRIER.
And YET HUNGRIER!
But hope is never lost... as long they have the organizers.
In order to make sure that not a single attendant doesn't go crazy or dead from the great
trial they are undergoing, the organizers display an act of kindness by giving them
delicious Hog Roast, one of the most precious, grandest meals that the world has ever
known.
The taste of such juicy, flavorful pork makes the Hackathon even more worthy of attending.
And after the wonderful meal, every one, both attendants and organizers, felt like
Kings and Queens, giving them even more determination to reach their goals. And every 
organizer's goal is to make sure everyone is learning and, more importantly, having fun.
And the goal for the attendants of the Hackathon is not only the same,
but to witness the creation of their own hacks is (probably) the greatest glory of their
lives.
However...
The patience of anyone waiting in line for The Roast...
has been a test that day.
What you may not know is that someone, one of the many, might have had the hardest time
getting through that test.
Because they forgot to eat breakfast and lunch, the level of their hunger has become immeasurable.
Knowing that they needed to ensure they got a good meal, they began to prepare to implement Dijkstra's algorithum
