First step was to make a map using his own
algorithm, to find the shortest route. He assumed it would take infinity to
reach the Hog Roast, but he needed to find out how long it would ACTUALLY take to get from place to
place. He labeled all of the places that he could visit on his way there, from A-G.
A the beginning, G for the end, which would be the delicious roast.
Equipped with what we call a "MLH Swag-Bag", he put all of the papers that listed places
he hadn't been to yet.
