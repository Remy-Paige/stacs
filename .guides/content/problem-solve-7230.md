AlgERRithm Chapter 4

Dijkstra found it only takes 10 minutes to talk to fellow hackers, so he walks back to
point B, writing on the back of his hand with a powerful Sharpie Pen that the shortest
length of time for these routes is only 10 minutes.
He could go to points D or E.
He took Paper B out of his trusty Swag-Bag,
and demolished it to scraps.
*Click on both Points D and E, and then time how long it takes to get to both*
He wrote on his blackened hand about both of the times.
Due to the 50 minutes lost by MLH's Cup-stacking competition, it took a whole 50 minutes
to go there.
Now the shortest total time is 20 minutes.
And so, he travels back to A.
