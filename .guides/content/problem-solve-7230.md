Dijkstra found it only takes 10 minutes to talk to fellow hackers, so he walks back to
point B, writing on the back of his hand with a powerful Sharpie Pen that the shortest
length of time for these routes is only 10 minutes.
From here he needs to fin out the time to get to points D or E.

*Click on both Points D and E, and then time how long it takes to get to both*
He wrote on his blackened hand about both of the times.
Due to the 50 minutes lost by MLH's Cup-stacking competition, but only 15 to go through bloomberg
Now the shortest total time is 25 minutes.
He took Paper B out of his trusty Swag-Bag,
and demolished it to scraps. 
After going back to check on his team at point A every time, He continues to proceed through the all of the points.
And so, he finished his great map.
Along the way, he kept rewriting on his hand, front and back, crossing out numbers, now
knowing the shortest path.

Once he has his route organsied he travels back to A one last time to have fun before food, and once food is ogranised he follows the route and gets there in tome for applesauce.
