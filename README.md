## Codio Guides

To be able to edit this project you will first need to fork it by navigating to **Project > Fork** and select "Only Project" and give it a new name. Online courses in Codio are creating using our Guides tool, accessible under **Tools > Guides > Edit**. Course content is written in Markdown and you can embed images, videos, html (including iframes), code, assessments and custom buttons to call server side scripts. You can install any software you may need for your online course by opening a terminal **Tools > Terminal** and using the **apt-get** tool.

## Tutorial

Take a look at this blog [post](https://codio.com/blog/codio-guides-easily-create-online-courses-with-assessment/) which covers the basics to getting started and adding custom buttons. You can ignore the beginning part on project creation as you have been give an empty project. This [post](https://codio.com/blog/codio-guides-part-2-adding-media-to-your-online-course/) shows you how to add media to your guide and this example [project](https://codio.com/codio-units/java-example/tree/README.md) shows you how to write code tests and a reusable testing framework.

Good luck and happy coding.
